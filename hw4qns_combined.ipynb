    "1.2.d) Dropping the rows with missing data had the highest R^2 score at 0.870, then filling rows with a score of 0.817, then dropping columns with 0.702. Out of these three options, my preferred way to handle missing data would be to drop rows, but it depends on the data. Data where only one column is missing values but it's missing a lot of values, then it would be smart to just drop that column. But data like this set where dropping columns results in losing most of the features is going to hurt the predictive power of your data. Filling missing data with zeros is a decent option but it can skew the data. A column that was zero-mean would be best for filling missing values with zero. In general however, my preferred method to handle missing data would be to fill the missing values with a mean/median/mode of its feature, or use the k-Nearest-Neighbor algorithm for finding the best value to fill."
